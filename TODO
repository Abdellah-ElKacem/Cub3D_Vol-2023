 the code 255 << 24 | 0 << 16 | 0 << 8 | 0xFF, each part of the bitwise OR expression corresponds to one of the color components (Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha) in a 32-bit color value. Here's the reasoning behind the bit-shifting for each component:

255 << 24 (Red):

We want to set the red component to 255. In the 32-bit color value, the red component occupies the 8 most significant bits (bits 24 to 31).
Shifting 255 by 24 positions to the left effectively places the value 255 in the red component's position (bits 24 to 31).
0 << 16 (Green):

We want the green component to be 0. In the 32-bit color value, the green component occupies the next 8 bits (bits 16 to 23).
Shifting 0 by 16 positions to the left places 0 in the green component's position (bits 16 to 23), effectively clearing any previous value.
0 << 8 (Blue):

We want the blue component to be 0. In the 32-bit color value, the blue component occupies the 8 bits following the green component (bits 8 to 15).
Shifting 0 by 8 positions to the left places 0 in the blue component's position (bits 8 to 15), effectively clearing any previous value.
0xFF (Alpha):

We want the alpha component to be 255, which represents full opacity. In the 32-bit color value, the alpha component occupies the 8 least significant bits (bits 0 to 7).
0xFF is already in the correct position for the alpha component, as it occupies the 8 least significant bits.
So, the bit-shifting and bitwise OR operations are used to construct a 32-bit color value with specific values for each component (RGBA), ensuring that each component is in its proper position within the 32-bit value.
